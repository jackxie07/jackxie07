## 🔹 About Me
I’m a statistical programmer with 10+ years of experience delivering **regulatory submission deliverables, real-world evidence analyses, and Medical Affairs publications**.  My expertise spans **SAS (Base/Advanced, ADaM/SDTM, Macros), R (Shiny, tidyverse, data.table), SQL, Unix/Linux, and Git/GitHub**.  

👀 I enjoy building **standardized macro libraries, interactive dashboards, and reproducible workflows** that make analysis more efficient, transparent, and impactful.
